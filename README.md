# Cybersecurity Project Portfolio

## Overview
This repository showcases a collection of cybersecurity projects that demonstrate my skills across various domains, including Cyber Security, Cloud, Linux, Networking, and more. Each project is built with a focus on reliability and security.

## List of Projects

1. **Wireshark Analysis and Report Generation**  
   Capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark, identify potential threats, and create a detailed report.

2. **Web Application Vulnerability Analysis using SQL Injection and XSS**  
   Create a vulnerable web application (using HTML, SQL, and Python/PHP) and implement defenses against SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

3. **PowerShell Script for Windows Security Auditing**  
   Develop a PowerShell script to perform a security audit on Windows systems, focusing on compliance and vulnerability checks.

4. **Intrusion Detection & Prevention System with Snort/Suricata and ELK Stack**  
   Set up a robust Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Snort or Suricata, and integrate it with an ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for real-time monitoring and alerting.

5. **Threat Detection and Response System using MITRE ATT&CK and NIST CSF**  
   Build a Threat Detection and Response System for a simulated network environment using MITRE ATT&CK to map attack techniques and tactics, while aligning security controls and response measures with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

6. **Automated Incident Response with SOAR using Python**  
   Create a Python-based script to simulate a basic SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) process for automating incident response tasks.

7. **SIEM Use Case Development with ELK Stack**  
   Deploy a SIEM system using the ELK Stack and develop custom use cases to monitor and detect potential security incidents.

8. **Log Analysis and Threat Hunting with SIEM (Splunk or ELK Stack)**  
   Set up a SIEM system using Splunk or ELK Stack and conduct threat hunting exercises by analyzing logs from various sources (e.g., web server, firewall, IDS).

9. **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) using Wazuh**  
   Implement Wazuh, an open-source EDR solution, to monitor endpoints for threats, perform log analysis, and automate threat response.

## Conclusion
These projects reflect my practical experience and ability to implement various cybersecurity tools and techniques, from threat detection and response to secure software development. Each project aims to enhance my skills in addressing real-world cybersecurity challenges.
