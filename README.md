#  Project Details

## Overview
This is a cybersecurity project designed to showcase my skills aross many domains (but not limited to) including Cyber Security, Cloud, Linux, Networking etc... Built with a focus on reliability and security.

## List of Projects

- **Project 1: Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** – Set up and configure an open-source IDS (Snort or Suricata) on a Linux environment to detect malicious network traffic.
  
- **Project 2: Automated Incident Response with SOAR using Python** – Create a Python-based script that simulates a basic SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) process to automate incident response tasks.

- **Project 3: SIEM Use Case Development with ELK Stack** - Deploy a SIEM system using the ELK Stack and develop custom use cases to monitor and detect potential security incidents.

- **Project 4: Wireshark Analysis and Report Generation** – Capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark, identify potential threats, and create a detailed report.

- **Project 5: Web Application Vulnerability Analysis using SQL Injection and XSS** – Create a vulnerable web application (using HTML, SQL, and Python/PHP) and implement defenses against SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

- **Project 6: PowerShell Script for Windows Security Auditing** – Create a PowerShell script to perform a security audit on Windows systems, focusing on compliance and vulnerability checks.

- **Project 7: Log Analysis and Threat Hunting with SIEM (Splunk or ELK Stack)** – Set up a SIEM system using Splunk or ELK Stack and conduct threat hunting exercises by analyzing logs from various sources (e.g., web server, firewall, IDS).

- **Project 8: Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) using Wazuh** – Deploy Wazuh, an open-source EDR solution, to monitor endpoints for threats, perform log analysis, and automate threat response.
  
- **Project 9: Intrusion Detection & Prevention System with Snort/Suricata and ELK Stack** – Set up a robust Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Snort or Suricata, and integrate it with an ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for real-time monitoring and alerting.

- **Project 10: Threat Detection and Response System using MITRE ATT&CK and NIST CSF** – Develop a Threat Detection and Response System for a simulated network environment using MITRE ATT&CK to map attack techniques and tactics, while aligning your security controls and response measures with the NIST CSF. This project will demonstrate your ability to identify threats, implement defenses, and respond to incidents based on industry best practices.
